\begin{abstract}
This report provides the algorithms, formulations and code implementations that
allowed to build a recommendation system applicable to the medical environment.
The algorithm leveraged on the biological similarity among the known patients
to provide its suggestions.
The system implemented is an hybrid one which uses a content-based rating
method as a baseline for its ratings and improves them through a collaborative
filtering algorithm.
The results of the system had been evaluated using the RMSE scoring strategy
over datasets containing different numbers of available patients, and leading
to an average RMSE value of 0.31.
